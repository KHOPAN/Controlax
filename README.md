# Controlax
Controlax is a tool for controlling computers from computers through your LAN network, meaning the Controller side can control multiple Target(s), and the Target side can be controlled by various Controller(s).

# How to use
Controlax Controller required Java 19+ to run.
Controlax Target required Java 20+ to run.
On the Target side, you'll need to install Controlax Target 1 time only, because, on the Target side, Controlax has Auto Update and Auto Run feature, which allows Controlax to update itself and then run itself on startup.
On the Controller side, after installing Java, open the Controlax Controller and it will automatically scan for computers that have Controlax Target installed on your LAN network. And then you can use it, the UI is self-explanatory.
